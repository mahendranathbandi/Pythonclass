# it is order collection

# tuple=(5,)

#in this tuple we whave 2 methods are there one is count&index
#we can defind this
# a=() identety of the tuple
# a=(1,2,4,5)
# a=(1,"Mahi"2.5,5)
# tuple was immutable object it means we can`t change the vlaue in the tuple


# a=(1,3,2,4,5,9,8,7)
# b=a.index(5)
# print(b)
# in this method we cand find the indexing of the give vlaue
#
# a=(1,3,2,4,5,9,8,7)
# b=a.count(9)
# print(b)
# in this method we can find the number of repetables of the valuer in the give tuple
